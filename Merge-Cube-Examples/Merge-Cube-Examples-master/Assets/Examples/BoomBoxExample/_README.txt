Boom Box Example Scene

Goals of the scene and what you should learn from it:

- By using the MultiTarget object and its BasicTrackableEventHandler script, you can display an object whenever the cube is tracked. 

- Itâ€™s generally best to keep your objects the same size as the Merge Cube (scaled at 0.72) for better immersion and the sense of holding the object in your hands.

- Since the Merge Cube is interacted with by a phone and a headset, typical tap controls are still applicable to your program.
