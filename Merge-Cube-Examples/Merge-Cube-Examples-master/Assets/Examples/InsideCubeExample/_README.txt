InsideCube Example Scene

Goals of the scene and what you should learn from it:

- By using the MultiTarget object and its BasicTrackableEventHandler script, you can display an object whenever the cube is tracked. 

- By using an inverted cube (or other inverted 3D object), you can have objects and effects placed inside your cube.
